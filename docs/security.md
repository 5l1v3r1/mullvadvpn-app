# Mullvad VPN app security

This document describes the security properties of the Mullvad VPN app. It describes it for all
platforms and their differences.

This document does not describe *how* we reach and uphold these properties, just what they are.
See the [architecture](architecture.md) document for details on how this security is implemented.


## App states

### Disconnected

### Connecting

### Connected

### Disconnecting

### Blocked


## Firewall

The states above should probably explain what can and can't be reached in the different states.
But we might need/want this section in case there is something that does not fit above.

## DNS

Where are DNS requests sent?
